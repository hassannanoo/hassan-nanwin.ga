                 <li>When I was a child, i wanna become an Engineering.</li>
                 <li>I came to USA in 2008, everything look different than my country.</li>
                 <li>when i go school in USA, i was a very shy kid. Don't speak with nobody.</li>
                 <li>I have a lot when I was in school like I can't understand what people said.</li>
                 <li>I don't know how to read, write and definitly I can't speak english by the time.</li>
                 <li>when I was in High School I change my major to computer programming as my career because
                    i don't know what type of Engineering i wanted to be.</li>
                 <li>I was thinking about changing my computer programming major to fighter because in order to
                   become programming you need to know Math and I was so bad at math but I didn't wanna give up on my career.</li>
                 <li>Inside of me, I never wanna just give up on something that I don't know.
                   I always wanna give a trying because that how we learn new stuff by trying.</li>
